# Math Game  

## Description  
This is an interactive math game built using Python and the Pygame library. The game challenges players to solve math equations within a limited time, with increasing difficulty as they progress. It was created as part of my learning Python and game development with Pygame, as well as to have fun with coding.  

## Features  
- Randomly generated math questions with addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  
- Time-based challenges where the allowed time increases slightly for harder questions.  
- Interactive UI with clickable answer buttons.  
- Difficulty increases as you answer correctly.  
- Start and restart functionality.
